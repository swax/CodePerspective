	Location: D:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Microsoft Corporation\NuGet Package Manager\2.0.30619.9119
	Notes: All files are signed, XRay replaced to remove sigs
	Problem: Replaced PublicKeyTokens in NuGet.Tools.pkgdef with null because no longer signed, but still giving an error while loading

	Licensing dll has a field type - method System.Void *() - that isn't parsed correctly
	I think 'method' might be a field attribute and maybe a cecil bug - investigate


	deOps - problem expanding dictionaries keyvalue elements in some classes
	openTK - gives an assembly reference not found on compile
	xlibrary - method dependency graph to see if ViewModel can be refactored

	Need to start xray in admin mode
	Need to run nereid in admin mode
	only nereid.exe seems to run, other apps have this problem
		A call to PInvoke function 'XRay.Banshee.Core!Banshee.I18n.Catalog::gettext' has unbalanced the stack. 
		This is likely because the managed PInvoke signature does not match the unmanaged target signature. 
		Check that the calling convention and parameters of the PInvoke signature match the target unmanaged signature.
