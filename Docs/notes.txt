.Net 6 update
	The new .Net generally builds a wrapper exe around the main app dll
	This means to use XRay now you generally need to overwrite the dll with the xrayed version, you can't run xray side by side like before

XRay window not showing up on app start
	The deps.json file of the app needs to be updated with references to XLibrary, OpenTK and QuickFont 
	in order for the viewer to show. Should happen automatically as part of the build process.

Debugging why an assembly is not working:
	Load assembly.exe as a project in visual studio and start debugging
	Use Process Explorer see which version of the CLR is being loaded
	Use hidden option on Builder form to ildasm original and new assemblies

Why is XLibrary set to .Net 3.5?
	Paint.Net and Facebook Chat were not working with it set to 4.0
	Error: This assembly is built by a runtime newer than the currently loaded runtime and cannot be loaded
	Even though asm.MainModule.Runtime = TargetRuntime.Net_4_0; was recompiled, the 2.0 CLR was still being loaded
	Use Process explorer to see what version of the runtime is loaded
	.Net 3.5 uses the 2.0 runtime

Exception: Unable to cast object of type 'System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer' to type 'System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize'.
	When changing project from .Net 4.0 to 3.5 this exception comes up
	4.0 uses ISupportInitialize in generated forms code, 3.5 does not
	Solution - Remove any references to ISupportInitialize to fix

InvalidOperationException: Application exception mode cannot be changed once any Controls are created in the Application.
	If the target application uses SetUnhandledExceptionMode to catch unhandled exceptions then starting
		up the XRay viewer before the application starts up will prevent the target app from using SetUnhandledExceptionMode
	Solution - Turn off open visualization on startup

Why not tracking struct creation?
	Structs do not have parameterless .ctor functions
	Structs do not have deconstructors
	In MCForge it was causing a System.ExecutionEngineException
