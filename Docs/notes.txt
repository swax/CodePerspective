Why is XLibrary set to .Net 3.5?
	Paint.Net and Facebook Chat were not working with it set to 4.0
	Error: This assembly is built by a runtime newer than the currently loaded runtime and cannot be loaded
	Even though asm.MainModule.Runtime = TargetRuntime.Net_4_0; was recompiled, the 2.0 CLR was still being loaded
	Use Process explorer to see what version of the runtime is loaded
	.Net 3.5 uses the 2.0 runtime

Exception: Unable to cast object of type 'System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer' to type 'System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize'.
	When changing project from .Net 4.0 to 3.5 this exception comes up
	4.0 uses ISupportInitialize in generated forms code, 3.5 does not
	Solution - Remove any references to ISupportInitialize to fix

InvalidOperationException: Application exception mode cannot be changed once any Controls are created in the Application.
	If the target application uses SetUnhandledExceptionMode to catch unhandled exceptions then starting
		up the XRay viewer before the application starts up will prevent the target app from using SetUnhandledExceptionMode
	Solution - Turn off open visualization on startup
